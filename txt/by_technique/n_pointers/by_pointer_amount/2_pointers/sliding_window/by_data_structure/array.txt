Characteristics of the problems that can be solved by sliding window:
    1. That if a wider scope of the sliding window is valid, the narrower scope of that wider scope is valid mush hold.
    2. That if a narrower scope of the sliding window is invalid, the wider scope of that narrower scope is invalid mush hold.
